# CSH Drink for iOS

An iOS app for easy access to vending machines at [Computer Science House](//csh.rit.edu).

# Getting Started

Due to issues with Pods + Swift, installing `pod` via RubyGems is recommended.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sman591/csh-drink-ios.git
$ cd csh-drink-ios
$ bundle install
$ be pod install
```

Afterwards, open up the `CSH Drink.xcworkspace` file in Xcode
